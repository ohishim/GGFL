\arguments{
\item{yli}{list of group-wise vectors of an objective variable}

\item{Xli}{list of group-wise matrixes of explanatory variables which are took GGFL penalty}

\item{Zli}{list of group-wise matrixes of explanatory variables which are not took GGFL penalty}

\item{D}{list of adjacency relations}

\item{thres}{threshold for convergence judgement}

\item{Lambda}{candidates of tuning parameter
if "default", the candidates are defined following the paper;
if "uniform", the candidates are defined by uniformly dividing}

\item{MPinv}{if TRUE, the ordinary least square estimator is calculated by the Mooreâ€“Penrose inverse matrix}

\item{progress}{If TRUE, progress is displayed}

\item{out.all}{if TRUE, results for all tuning parameters are output;
if FALSE, results for only the optimal tuning parameter are output}

\code{GGFLa.cda} More general version of Coordinate optimization for GGFL.
This allows to use explanatory variables which are not took GGFL penalty.
